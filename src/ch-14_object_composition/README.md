# Object Composition

"Favor object composition over class inheritance". Gang of Four

Class inheritance is the strongest kind of coupling in OO Design.

## Problems
- Base class
- Gorilla/Banana
- Duplication by need

## Main forms of Object Composition
- **Aggregation**. An Object that contains other objects. Each subobject can be destructured from the parent. 
- **Concatenation**. Adding new properties to an existing object.
- **Delegation**.
